# Stock Analysis Overview
The goal of this project was to use prior VBA code used to analysis Stocks for a given year, and refactor it the best we can to run faster. By doing this, if Steve would like to add more stocks to the data set, it will run much faster then before.

## Results Of Stocks
Firstly, if we looked at high performers in 2017 like SPWR, DQ, ENPH, and FSLR then on the surface these all would be great stocks to invest in. However given the 2018 data, we can see that the only stocks out of those 4 that were postive was ENPH. DQ was the worst performer in 2018 and given the high difference in year to year returns, it seems that DQ is a highly volitile stock to invest in. We can only recomend that ENPH, and RUN be invested in as they are the only two stocks to have positive returns year over year. If we could look at more statistics, we could see how volitile all the stocks are and pick a fairly even stock that has constant returns year over year for the parents.

## Results Of Refactoring
The refactored script ran much faster as seen with these images.
